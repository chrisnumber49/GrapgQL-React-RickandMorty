## Reflection

This is my first side project of learning GraphQL with Apollo Client and React. In this project, I built an interface to list all characters in Rick and Morty and let users check character's appearance in episodes in the show. I started this project by using the command `create-react-app` to create the boilerplate, then several additional libraries `Bootstrap`, `react-router-dom`, `GraphQL`, and `Apollo Client` was installed during the development of this project.

The technologies implemented in this project include React, React Router, Bootstrap, GraphQL, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. Through this side project, I learned about the basic concept of GraphQL, what's the difference between GraphQL and REST API, and lastly the GraphQL Hooks useQuery and useLazyQuery.
